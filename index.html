            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Tan Bo Sheng, a Materials Engineering student at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. </p>
        <p>I’m passionate about exploring the intersection between engineering, data analytics, and technology to solve real-world challenges.</p>
        <p>Currently, I’m honing my skills in programming, data analysis, and artificial intelligence, with the goal of applying these abilities to both engineering and data-driven industries. </p>
        <p>My academic journey has given me hands-on experience with tools like MySQL, SolidWorks 2024, and data analysis, while my work on school projects has deepened my research, problem-solving, and technical skills.</p>
        <p>Beyond academics, I’ve contributed to various roles in my school’s MSE Club, managing logistics, digital media outreach, and publicity sparately in each Academic Year.</p>
        <p>Other than my school club I am also part of NTU Student Union as a Strategy Officer under the Strategy Office committee</p>
        <p>Where I worked on a report and analyzed events to recommend strategies and KPI's that Student Union can implement in the future to enagage students better.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Personally I am always eager to learn new skills, take on fresh challenges, and connect with like-minded individuals.</p>
        <p>My primary interest lies in data analytics, where I aim to uncover meaningful insights and drive data-driven decision-making across industries.</p>
        <p>Whether it’s through analyzing complex datasets, developing AI-powered solutions, or applying engineering principles to real-world problems</p>
        <p>I’m committed to using data as a tool for innovation and impactful change.</p>

        <p>In this video taken from my project submission of my course "Designing & Developing Databases"</p>
        <p> I proposed a chatbot design idea with the purpose of handling exceptional case in which was described as turbulence compensation cases by our project question.</p>
        <p>This video briefly describes the process of design and the assumptions made to maximise likelihood of ensuring customer satisfaction and experience.</p>
        <p>This is to not only show how I approach such an abstract question but also show my analysis and problem solving skill</p>
